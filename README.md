This Python script generates unique license keys for software products. 
Each key includes a random alphanumeric portion and a 6-digit certificate number enclosed in curly braces. 

Features:

* Cryptographically secure random character generation
* Hyphens for improved readability (e.g., ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP-{123456})
* Customizable key length (default is 16 characters excluding hyphens and certificate number)
* Automatic certificate number generation

Usage:

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save this script as a .py file (e.g., license_key_generator.py)
3. Run the script from your terminal using the command: `python license_key_generator.py`
4. The script will print five example license keys to your console.

Customizing:

* Key Length: Modify the `length` parameter in the `generate_license_key` function to change the number of characters in the alphanumeric part.
* Certificate Number Length: Adjust the range in the `cert_number` generation to control the number of digits in the certificate.
* Output: If you need more than five keys, change the range in the `for` loop. 

Additional Notes:

* For even stronger security, consider storing generated keys in a database to prevent duplicates and manage license activation/deactivation.
* You can easily modify this script to add prefixes, suffixes, or other custom elements to your license keys.
